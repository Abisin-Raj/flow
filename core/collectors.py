"""
Collectors Module.

This module is the data ingestion engine for network traffic.
It periodically polls system network state (via `ss`, `/proc/net`, or `netstat`),
parses the active connections, enriches them with process information (PID, name),
saves them to the `Connection` database, and evaluates them against alert rules.
